;<$text text="""Result is <$calc>1 + 1</$calc>""" />
:Result is <$calc>1 + 1</$calc>

;<$text text="""Result is <$calc>{{!!test}} + 1</$calc>""" />
:Result is <$calc>{{!!test}} + 1</$calc>

It's also possible to use the list widget inside the <$text text="""<$calc>""" /> widget to create sums of lists.
